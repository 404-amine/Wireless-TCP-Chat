# Server-Client Communication Project

This project demonstrates a basic server-client communication setup using sockets in C programming language. It includes a server program (`server.c`) and a client program (`client.c`) that communicate over a local network (WiFi).

## Features

- **Server**: Listens for incoming client connections and displays received messages.
- **Client**: Connects to the server and sends messages.
- **soon**  currently working on implementing End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for more security 
## Requirements

- GCC compiler (or any C compiler that supports POSIX sockets)
- Linux or Unix-like environment (Windows with WSL also work)
